Question: How do I register a new business in NSW?

Answer: To register a new business in NSW, you can visit the Service NSW website and follow the instructions for business registration. You will need to provide details about your business, such as the business name, address, and type of business. You may also need to obtain an Australian Business Number (ABN) and register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) if applicable. For more information, you can refer to the [Service NSW Business Registration page](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/register-business-name).
